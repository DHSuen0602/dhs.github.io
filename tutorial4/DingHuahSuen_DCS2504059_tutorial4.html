A <font size=6><i><b>shepherd</b></i></font> boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields
near the forest. He felt this job was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</p>

<p>
<align=justify>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying
away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but
didn't find any wolf.
</p>

<p>
<align=justify>
The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here". <font size=6><i><b>The boy
played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</b></i></font>
</p>

<p>
<align=justify>
After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep,
suddenly, a wolf came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs.
The boy was frightened and cried loudly. "Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying a
lamb away!"</strike>
</p>

<p>
<align=justify>
<font color=purple size=6>The farmers <sup>thought</sup> the boy was playing mischief again.</font> So, no one paid
attention to him  and didn't come to his help.
